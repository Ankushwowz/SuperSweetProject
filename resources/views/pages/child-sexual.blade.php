        Child Sexual Abuse Material Policy
      </h1>
   </div>
   <div class="first-pph">
      <h5 class="heading-pph">
        We have a zero-tolerance policy towards any material that sexualizes, sexually exploits, or endangers children on our platform. If we find or are made aware of it, we will report it. 
      </h5>
      <p class="pargraph-hpp" style="color:#000;">
        Super Sweet Club is deeply committed to fighting the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). This includes media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated images. We view it as our responsibility to ensure our platform is not used for sharing or consuming CSAM, and to deter users from searching for it.
      </p>
      <p class="pargraph-hpp" style="color:#000;">
      Any content featuring or depicting a child (real, fictional, or animated) or promoting child sexual exploitation is strictly forbidden on our platform and is a severe violation of our <a href="{{ URL::to('/') }}/pages/termsof-service" class="terms-set color-child">Terms of Service.</a> Written content (including, but not limited to, comments, content titles, content descriptions, messages, usernames, or profile descriptions) that promotes, references, or alludes to the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child is also strictly prohibited.
      </p>
      <p class="pargraph-hpp" style="color:#000;">
        For the purposes of this policy, a child is any person under eighteen (18) years of age. We report all cases of apparent CSAM to the <a href="#" class="terms-set color-child">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children </a>(NCMEC), a nonprofit organization which operates a centralized clearinghouse for reporting incidents of online sexual exploitation of children. NCMEC makes reports available to appropriate law enforcement agencies globally.
      <p class="pargraph-hpp" style="color:#000;">
        Additionally, at Super Sweet Club, we endorse and stand behind the objectives of the <a href="#" class="terms-set color-child">Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse;</a>a collaborative initiative launched by the Five Country Ministerial (5 Eyes)[1] and backed by industry-leading tech companies to combat online child sexual exploitation and abuse. We believe robust, efficient, and flexible policies, as well as participating in and supporting global cross-sector collaboration, can effectively eradicate the spread of online abuse.   
      </p>
      <p class="pargraph-hpp" style="color:#000;">
      If you encounter child sexual abuse material on Super Sweet Club, please report it to us via our  <a href="{{ URL::to('/') }}/pages/non-consensual-content-policy" class="terms-set color-child">CONTENT REMOVAL REQUEST FORM. </a> For information on how to report Child Sexual Abuse Material please refer to the Additional Resources and Support section below.

        Anyone can report potential violations of this policy. 
      </h5>

      All complaints and reports to Super Sweet Club are kept confidential and are reviewed by human moderators who work swiftly to handle the content appropriately. <span class="font-child">If you believe a child is in imminent danger, please also alert your local law enforcement authorities immediately.</h5>
